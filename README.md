# Hello there.
</div>

Hey everyone! I'm Clément (alias drawbu), a French student in computer science.
I'm currently at Epitech Bordeaux in second year, after one year at the public
college [l'Université de Bordeaux](http://u-bordeaux.fr).

But the most important thing is, I'm a pationate about computer science, about 
programming, I'm basically a nerd. I really enjoy learning new tools, 
technologies, architectures, concepts, trying new things, and go out of my 
confort zone. 

Today, I'm on Linux, (with the holy NixOS) because I enjoy spending my time on,
but I have a fair amount of knowledge on both Windows and macOS.

I used to be a Python fan because this is what I started with, and ~recently I
got interested about web dev (back & front, but I enjoyed back really more).
I pu some websites in prod with SSL support using Nginx + systemd + ACME (you 
can read about it
[here, on a acticle I made](https://github.com/drawbu/Notes/blob/main/Server%20administration/Server%20block%20Ubuntu%20%2B%20Nginx%20%2B%20systemd.md)).
I am also intrested about the C Programming Language, and all the toolchain 
surronding it.

I have a few hobbies: developing useless stuff, playing Minecraft, and watching
a lot of series (seriously, please watch Breaking Bad and For All Mankind).
